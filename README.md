Collected resources and getting started with Azure PCIe FPGA device

## Introduction

Getting started with production grade high-end FPGA devices is usually either extremely expensive (with official dev kits) or daunting (using refurbished hardware). This makes it prohibitive to start as a hobbyist.

There is a body of knowledge around the MSFT Azure Storey Peak boards which can be bought online for $80.

In this repo, I collect the different sources available online and add some of my own code that makes this all work on Windows.

There is a blog to support this repo on getting started quickly [here](todo).
